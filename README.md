# Job Ad to Sub-Sequence Text Processor
This contains a minimal working example of the code used in "Remote Work across Jobs, Companies and Space" by Hansen, Lambert, Bloom, Davis, Sadun &amp; Taska (2023).

I provide my R script, and 100 example job vacancy postings, which come from Lightcast.  Each vacancy posting has been web-scraped from the internet.  The examples are drawn randomly from the US in 2021.

The script aims to split these up into sub-sequences.  It attempts to preserve the structure of the underlying job ad, but does this in a way that is naive to the meaning of the document.  One could improve this using more advanced methods, but these would come at a computational cost which was not feasibly to pay in our use case of processing hundreds of millions of ads.
